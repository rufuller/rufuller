- 👋 Hi, I’m Rulonda Fuller
  
- 👀 I’m transitioning into technical writing from creative writing and occasionally dabble in HTML and CSS.
- 🌱 I have 5+ years of experience in content writing/editing. I have:
  • Written/edited high-performing SEO blogs and articles for marketing and nonprofit organizations
  • Copy edited and line edited numerous books (fiction and nonfiction) for indie authors
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rulondafuller)

For Fun 🎉

Outside of work, you can find me reading fiction 📖, listening to Broadway show tunes 🎵, or breaking out my typewriter to write poetry, letters 📩, or practice good tech documentation! 😎
