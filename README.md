👋 Hi, I’m Rulonda Fuller
  
👀 I’m a content writer/editor with a creative writing background, strengthening my skills in technical writing and occasionally dabbling in HTML and CSS.

- Write/edit internal documentation and SOPs
- Write user documentation for typewriter maintenance and use.
- Write and edit blogs and articles to ensure clear communication and match brand voice.

For Fun 🎉

Outside of work, you can find me reading fiction 📖, listening to Broadway show tunes 🎵, or breaking out my typewriter to write poetry, letters 📩, & practice good tech documentation! 😎
